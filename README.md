# Multi-Omics Cancer Classification using CRO and xAI

This repository contains the code and resources for a thesis on **Multi-Omics Cancer Classification using Diversity Controlled Chemical Reaction Optimization (DC-CRO) and Explainable AI (xAI)**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The objective of this research is to classify breast cancer (BRCA) subtypes using multi-omics data (RNA-Seq, Copy Number Variation, Mutation, and Protein expression) and optimize the classification process using Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) for feature selection.

## 🚀 Current Progress: Week 1 Completed
The baseline pipeline has been established with the following achievements:
- **Data Deduplication:** Handled high-dimensional feature spaces.
- **Target Preparation:** Prepared 3 clinical targets (`ER.Status`, `HER2.Final.Status`, and `histological.type`).
- **Data Leakage Prevention:** Used proper pipelines to ensure SMOTE is applied only within cross-validation folds.
- **Baseline Models:** Evaluated Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost using Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation.

### 📊 Baseline Results Summary
XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model across all targets. The full results are saved in the `outputs/baseline_metrics/` directory.

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Execute Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python run_week1.py

## 🔮 Next Steps (Week 2)
- Implementation of the **Diversity Controlled Chemical Reaction Optimization (DC-CRO)** skeleton.
- Feature selection using CRO to improve the performance of weaker models on imbalanced targets.
